# Hello 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore. I’ve worked as a software engineering intern at Binance, GovTech, and Cynapse AI. \
\
I'm building a [relational database in C++](https://github.com/raihahahan/cpp-relational-db), with ideas inspired from Postgres and sqlite. I'm passionate about database internals and distributed systems, and currently diving deep into C++. I’ve also built and published several mobile apps.

## Tools I built for myself

1. [ParkMyBike](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parkmybike-bicycle-parking/id6741011216): An iOS app that shows bicycle parking locations around Singapore
2. [SG Locations](https://github.com/raihahahan/singapore-places-names): Built this to create my own locations drop down on text search for [ParkMyBike](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parkmybike-bicycle-parking/id6741011216) as I couldn't afford Google APIs back then
3. [RevenueCat REST API cli](https://github.com/raihahahan/revenue-cat-rest-api-cli): A CLI tool to quickly refund RevenueCat purchases from the command line (no longer maintained)
4. [nusgpacalculator.com](https://www.nusgpacalculator.com/): Simple GPA calculator and simulator that allows you to upload your transcript for quick calculation
