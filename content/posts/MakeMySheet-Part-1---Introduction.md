> [MakeMySheet](https://makemysheet.com) is an AI music transcriber tool that converts music audio into music sheet. MakeMySheet is a project I created with [Shi Xin](https://github.com/apollo-tan) for NUS Orbital at the Artemis level. The contents here were taken from our [ReadMe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MSCzP2GQiQ_NtrvwtkeRR3pjgD7xxjvQ/view), with some portions cut off to reduce redundancy. This post is part of a series of posts where I break down the technical decisions behind MakeMySheet.\

# Introduction

MakeMySheet is an AI-driven tool designed to convert audio files into piano sheet music, catering to hobbyist musicians, aspiring songwriters, music students, and professionals. It provides an efficient way to transcribe pop songs into piano arrangements, eliminating the need for manual transcription. The platform offers both a web interface and a Telegram bot for easy access to the service.

## Motivation

The project stems from a passion for music, especially for those who wish to play piano covers but lack the technical expertise for transcribing and arranging songs. While quality arrangements are available online, they often come at a cost, and free resources may be inaccurate. MakeMySheet aims to offer an accessible solution by automating transcription, benefiting both hobbyists and professional musicians alike.
