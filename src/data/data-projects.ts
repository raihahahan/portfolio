      "Iâ€™m the creator of <a style='color: blue;' href='https://www.melonbase.com/projects/park-my-bike-sg' target='_blank'>**ParkMyBike SG**</a>, an Android app that shows bicycle parking locations around Singapore. As of the time of writing, the app is still under Play Store review. An iOS version will soon be released. I did everything myself including the logo and the UX design using Figma.\n\nThe app fetches data from the <a href='https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html' style='color: blue;' target='_blank'>**LTA DataMall API**</a> and displays the bicycle parking locations as pressable markers on the app's map with <a href='https://www.mapbox.com/' target='_blank' style='color: blue;'>**Mapbox**</a>. It has several features such as Nearby Search (locations near the user's geolocation), Normal Search, Pin Search (reverse search by placing a pin) and Favourites. It also has dark mode functionality.",

This helped in my understanding of Java, state management systems such as Redux, and improved the way I write and structure my code.",
