I currently focus on building Android and iOS apps with React Native and Expo EAS. I created an informal entity called <a href='https://www.melonbase.com' target='_blank' style='color: ${linkColor};'>**Melonbase**</a> for the sole purpose of curating my mobile app(s) that are published to the store into a single entity.\n\nI hope to expand my skillsets beyond React and React Native to areas such as native mobile app development (Java/Swift) and Data Science/Analytics.\n\n I will be pursuing Computer Science in late 2023. In the meantime, I work on self projects, take online courses and try to keep up with the latest tech.\n\nI do not have relevant work experience in technology yet, but I am willing to take on an internship before my university starts. You may contact me as shown below.",
